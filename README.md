## Analysis of Corporate Bankruptcy Trends

### Overview

This project tackles the critical challenge of predicting corporate bankruptcy using machine learning techniques and financial data analysis. Our goal is to develop predictive models that accurately forecast the likelihood of bankruptcy based on historical financial data, providing actionable insights to stakeholders and decision-makers.

### Repository Contents

-   `.arff files`: Contains the dataset in ARFF format used for the analysis.
-   `Project_Bankruptcy_code.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook (`.ipynb`) with all the coding and analysis performed in a cloud environment.
-   `final project report`: Includes the Final Project Report in PDF format which outlines the comprehensive analysis, methodology, results, and conclusions of the project.

### Data Description

The dataset, provided by the Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS), focuses on companies operating in Poland between 2000 and 2013. It includes 64 real-valued features in ARFF format, representing financial ratios and indicators crucial for predicting the bankruptcy status over five forecasting periods.

### Google Colab Notebook

The Google Colab notebook contains the executable code and visualizations necessary to replicate the analysis. It allows for direct interaction and modification without the need for local environment setup, facilitating easier collaboration and sharing.

### Final Project Report

The Final Project Report available in PDF format provides an in-depth view of the project’s motivation, methods, results, and conclusions. It serves as a valuable resource for understanding the detailed outcomes and implications of the study.

### Handling ARFF Files

ARFF (Attribute-Relation File Format) files are particularly useful for machine learning projects due to their ability to encapsulate metadata about the dataset’s attributes. Users should use tools that directly support ARFF, such as Weka, or convert the files into CSV format for use in other programming environments.

### Models Developed

The project explores several machine learning models:

1.  **Logistic Regression**
2.  **Hard-Margin SVM**
3.  **Neural Network via TensorFlow and Keras**
4.  **Ensemble Model**

Each model is assessed through various performance metrics such as precision, recall, accuracy, and computational efficiency to determine their predictive power.

### Results

The analysis results are detailed in the Colab notebook and summarized in the Final Project Report. They highlight the performance of each model, providing a critical evaluation based on precision, recall, accuracy, and other relevant metrics.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effective application of machine learning to predict corporate bankruptcy. It provides stakeholders with powerful tools to mitigate financial risks proactively. Future work may include refining models, incorporating more diverse datasets, and developing real-time prediction capabilities.
